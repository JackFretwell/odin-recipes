        <h3>Description</h3>
        A special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but this recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 diced onion</li>
            <li>1 canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 chops of parsley</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>A dash of sugar</li>
            <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 tub of cottage cheese</li>
            <li>300g of shredded mozzarella</li>
            <li>2 eggs </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>
            <li>Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</lil>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
            <li> Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
